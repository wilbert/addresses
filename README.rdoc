This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.

* State (belongs to country)
* City (belongs to State)
* Neighborhood (belongs to city)
* Address (Belongs to Neighborhood and City, because neighborhood is not required)

    gem 'addresses', git: 'https://github.com/wilbert/addresses'

After this, add this line to your routes:

    mount Addresses::Engine => "/addresses"

    rake addresses:install:migrate
    rake db:migrate

    rake addresses

    address.complement = "Complement of address"
    address.zipcode = "zipcode"
